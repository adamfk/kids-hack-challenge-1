# Hard Mode
You can determine guesses that are too high or too low without the help of the hacking console. Watch the behavior of the computer to determine if your guess is too high or too low.

# URL Arguments
Can be used to modify the behavior of the program. See the top of the js.js file for a list of arguments.

Example: `<some-url>/index.html?seconds=240&skip-intro-help&` will set the timer to 240 seconds and skip the intro help alert window.
